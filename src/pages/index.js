    <p>How it works
Just pick your event, from concerts to sports games, and invite your friends. Then they invite their friends and everyone buys their own tickets. Fevo handles the rest, including seating you all together.
Your tickets always come directly from inventory owners, because Fevo partners with the industry's leading primary ticket sellers and venues to create a best-in-class experience.
